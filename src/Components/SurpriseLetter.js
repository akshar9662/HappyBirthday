          Dear Shivani,
          <br /><br />
          On this special day, I just wanted to take a moment to remind you how truly amazing you are.
          Your smile lights up every room, your kindness touches every heart, and your presence makes life better for everyone around you.
          <br /><br />
          May this birthday bring you as much enjoy as you bring to others.
          I hope all your dreams come true and every moment is filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable memories.
          <br /><br />
          Keep shining like the beautiful soul you are. ðŸŒŸ
          <br /><br />
          With love,<br />
          Your Brother ðŸ’–
